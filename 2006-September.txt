Subject: [ydf-users] YDDatabaseObject reseting
Message-ID: <44F86748.5040703@fusemail.com>

Hi db

When reseting ( with reset() or resetAll() ) i get variables reseted and 
that's is ok. the problem is that it resets _my_ variables too (an not 
only the ones used in the YDDatabaseObject).

Maybe YDDatabaseobject should reset only variables that are fields?

This way this simple code could work (as expected):

class C extends YDDatabaseobject;

	function C(){

		...
		$this->setField( 'xpto' );
	}


	function X(){

		$this->form = new YDForm( 'f' );

		$this->resetAll();

		//...
		
		$this->form->setDefaults( ... );
	}
}

As you can see, with the previous code and with the current 
YDDatabaseObject this don't work because $resetAll() of YDDatabaseobject 
deletes the form variable and it shouldn't.

What you think to make reset deleting only its fields?

Hi db

After looking to YDDatabaseObject implementation i see that it ignores 
variables staring with underscore.. :)

I'm changing all variables now..

Anyway, what you think about checking if variable is a field before delete?

Hi,

I am seeing some strange behaviour when results from a
YDDatabaseObject 
are assigned to the template.

This is my code:

    $this->page->fetch();
                       
    $page_data = $this->page->getValuesAsAssocArray();
                      
    // add the data to the template
    $this->tpl->assign( 'page',      $page_data );
    $this->tpl->assign( 'page_data', $page_data );

Now you would expect that the template variables
'page' and 'page_data' 
would be set with the same data.

In this case the data in the 'page' template variable
(an associative 
array) has only two of the elements set and all of the
other fields are 
missing.

Regards,

Graeme

As you can see in YDF user guide ( 
http://ydframework.berlios.de/doc/ydfilesystem_using_images.html ), 
YDFSImage class only handles _local_ image files (and not web URLs).

Maybe you should use YDHttpClient or YDUrl. See ( 
http://ydframework.berlios.de/doc/ydurl.html ).

The function resetValues() can reset only the fields of the object.

You are suggesting that reset() should use resetValues() instead of
resetObject() - that clears the object completely?

I don't know... Maybe we could add a paremeter to reset(
[$only_fields=false] ). What do you think?

If $only_fields == true than use resetValues() and the other calls
(resetQuery, resetResults, etc). If $only_fields == false (default) do the
same thing that it's doing now.

I was thinking more about this and the way reset() is working today is not
that good.

reset() should "reset" the object to it's initial state, or close to it. So
it should reset the fields, selects and also reset relations vars (not doing
this now).

I commited my changes to the svn repository and the main differences are:

- added resetRelations that reset all relations
- added parameter to reset( $all=false ) that resets everything in the
object including relations and other custom variables when true.
- modified resetValues to reset selects values too

I'm using resetAll() in all methods. All i want to do is, as you said, 
clean the YDDatabaseObject to make other query types and to assign other 
values from the beginning.

The problem is that when extending YDDatabaseObject, resetAll() deletes 
not only its own varibles but my class variables too.. and i can't find 
a reason for that.


Is resetAll() now deleting their fields (deleting variables that are a 
registered fields), relations ?

Commited another version of YDDatabaseObject that will behave as you wish.

reset() don't have a parameter and will reset only registered field values,
select values, query values and results.
resetAll() will execute a reset() in the object and also a resetRelations()
that will reset all relation objects.

If you want to completely clear an object you can use resetObject().

Hi Everybody

    I have some problem with sending html mail.

    The following is the code I used to send mail.
    
    $eml = new YDEmail();
    $eml->setFrom( 'moses at hysistechnologies.com', "Moses" );
    $eml->addTo( "moses at hysistechnologies.com");
    $eml->setSubject( 'Hello ' );
    $eml->setHtmlBody( $body );
    $eml->send();

    but the mail is not send.

    So I tried with the normal php mail function.

    mail($to,$subject,$body) --> works fine

    but  
   
   mail($to,$subject,$body,$headers) --> does not work works . To my
knowledge what I understood is that the problem is because of adding
headers.

   But I am not sure is it its because of adding headers or any other
server settings.

  I have given the details below (ie)  echo  in   class.phpmailer.php   
   @mail($to, $this->EncodeHeader($this->Subject), $body, $header);  

---------$to---------------

moses at hysistechnologies.com 

---------$body---------------

Subject: [ydf-users] YDDatabaseObject - another feature
Message-ID: <44FDB54D.3020700@fusemail.com>

Hi David

When using YDDatabaseObject i create ( only in my mind ) a new feature 
that i think it's very useful and can make the development with 
YDDatabaseObject easier and with a _huge_ performance improvement.

See this simple example..
I have 4 different class objects (that are YDDatabaseObject extensions) 
in a array:

array( $classA, $classB, $classC, $classD );


. and each one has a method that do some DELETE stuff:


class A{
	...
	function deleteRow(){
		$this->resetAll();
		$this->id = X;
		$this->delete();
	}
}


.. now, if i want to delete _all_ objects i must do:

foreach( $array as $obj )
	$obj->deleteRow();


This is ok.. works but it's not performant. In this simple scenario i 
will make 4 db calls.


Now, how to solve this in better way: with a new YDDabataseObject called 
YDDabataseObject::deleteSQL() that "returns the SQL string that would by 
  used by YDDabataseObject::delete()".

Then i would only need to:

class A{
	...
	function deleteRow(){
		$this->resetAll();
		$this->id = X;
		return $this->deleteSQL();
	}
}


and..

foreach( $array as $obj )
	$sql .= $obj->deleteRow();

$db->execute( $sql );


This could be an _huge_ performance boost because i would only need 1 db 
call for all objects. Imagine if i have 100 objects, instead of 100 db 
calls (as i need now) i would only need 1. This is something like a 
transactional call and is the best way of doing it. Maybe someday we 
could make execute transactional too and then this will be perfect.


What do you think about it?

So, the answer is yes.. as long as you agree with LGPL terms. But maybe 
Pieter can answer better.

If i was you, i would include the latest subversion version.

You can retrieve the SQL query that would be used without executing it by
setting the YDConfig variable YD_DBOBJECT_EXECUTE to false. Example:

YDConfig::set( 'YD_DBOBJECT_EXECUTE', false );

$obj->id = 1;
$sql = $obj->delete();

YDConfig::set( 'YD_DBOBJECT_EXECUTE', true ); // get it back to normal use

Now $sql will have something like:

DELETE FROM table WHERE id = 1

Is this what you want?

Notice that you can use this config variable YD_DBOBJECT_EXECUTE to retrieve
the SQL queries from find(), update(), insert() and delete().

Yes, the Yellow Duck Framework can be included in your own projects. If you
do so, it's best to include the latest subversion version. (I haven't had
the time to make a new release yet.)

Yes.. but it would be very useful to integrate them in the YDDatabaseObject.

Do you mind to add those? eg:


function deleteSQL(){

	$exe = YDConfig::get( 'YD_DBOBJECT_EXECUTE' );
	       YDConfig::set( 'YD_DBOBJECT_EXECUTE', false );
	$res = $this->delete();
	       YDConfig::set( 'YD_DBOBJECT_EXECUTE', $exe );
	return $res;
}

Can you add it to YDDatabaseObject? Also include updateSQL, insertSQL and
findSQL.

So, i get a error:

Fatal error: Class '' not found in YDFramework2\YDF2_process.php on line 59



Any ideas?

Message-ID: <20060913105444.1634.qmail@web54007.mail.yahoo.com>

    Hi,

I'm experimenting with YDDatabseTree.php for the first time and itseems that the current implementation requires a field in the tablecalled 'position'.

This seems to be incorrect or is inconsistent with the SQL for settingup the example in database_trees.php (there is no position field).

After creating a database table containing the data in the example,this is the error in my server logs:

PHP Fatal error:  [1054] Unknown column 'position' in 'field list' in../YDFramework2/YDClasses/YDDatabase.php on line 1531, referer:../examples/database_tree.php

To get the example working, I added a position column to the mysqltable.

Does the 'position' field need to be removed from the YDDatabaseTreeconstructor?

Thanks,

Graeme

The 'position' field was created with the intention to add position 
support (read: be able to order children of same parent).


IMHO, the ideal is make 'position' a optional.. ( by another words, make 
position support in YDDatabaseTree optional).

I don't want to make it optional as I will add full support for positions in
a later stage. If we do so, we need to have a position field.

I fixed the example in build 2135.

Sounds a good idea.

  Hi Pieter & Francisco,

I guessed that the position field was for ordering children and can seethe benefits of doing so. A 'setChildPosition' method would be a niceway to move a child element to a specific position. You could also havemoveChildToFirst( $id ), moveChildToLast ( $id ), moveChildLeft( $id,$n ) and moveChildRight( $id, $n ). The last two would move the child Npositions (within the current parent).

I am working on a modification to YDDatabaseTree that enables a filterto be set. The aim of the filter is to enable multiple trees (e.g. onetree per user) to reside in a single database table and for rebuild ofone tree not to affect another tree in the same table.

This filter has the effect of adding criteria into all of the selectclauses and correspondingly to the insert / update clauses.

Usage currently looks like this:

            $this->_tree = new YDDatabaseTree2( $this->_db,'tree', 'id', 'parent_id', 'title' );

            // add a custom field
            $this->_tree->addFields( array( 'userid' ) );
            
            // add a default value for the custom field
            $this->_tree->setAddDefaults( array( 'userid' =>$userid ) );
            
            // set the filter used for all tree operations
            $this->_tree->setFilter( 'userid = ' . $userid );

For a cleaner implementation I think I could combine setFilter andsetAddDefaults into one method. If the argument is an array of defaults/ criterias, then multiple columns could be used for filtering. If moreadvanced criteria operation is needed other than "=" then I think amethod that takes a callback function as an argument is a possiblesolution. 

I'll see how this implementation goes in my application. As this changeis in the early stages I would appreciate suggestions for the filtermethods to provide.

Hi Everybody

     I have a problem with paging....

     I am executing more than four queries one by one and at last I get
the array of records which contains nearly 1000 records.
   
    So need to do paging for the resultant array.

    But the argument for the getRecordsAsSet() is only one single 
$query.

    But my situation is like I cant get the resultant array with a
single query I need the execute more than three queries.

   For this situation how should I  use   getRecordsAsSet()  function.

regards
moses

.. but you would do that with YDDatabaseTree::moveNode, i think.

Currently, with moveNode( $id, $new_parent ) you can define the new 
parent only.. with a new moveNode, eg, moveNode( $id, $new_parent, 
$position ) then you have:

moveChildToFirst( $id )  == moveNode( $id, null, 1 )

moveChildToLast( $id )   == moveNode( $id, null, -1 )

but i don't know about moveChildLeft/moveChildRight..

A
+- B
|
+- C
|
+- D
|  +- X
|  +- Y
|
+--E

If moveChildLeft is applyed to X what would be the new parent? C? A?


My opinion, is that moveNode is the best way because it's the most basic 
and powerfull. With moveNode we define exactly what we want, eg:


moveNode( X, A, 1 );   or    moveNode( X, C, 1 );

moveNode( E, D, 2 );

You can create a YDResultSet object from the array of 1000 records which
does exactly what you are looking for.

Message-ID: <20060921080011.33838.qmail@web54004.mail.yahoo.com>

  Hi,

Can someone explain how the syntax addEvent( "*", ... ) is used toprovide YDAjax default event processing? There are no examples of thisso I can't see how to use it or why I would use it.

I am also trying to find out how to generate a form in a response andwhether addEvent can be used in the response. My reason for wanting tocreate a form in a response is that I am trying to work out a techniquefor creating modal forms that popup within the existing page and behavelike modal dialog boxes.

I could pre-create the modal forms in the request and hide them but Ithink this could have security implications ...

Thanks,

Graeme

Message-ID: <200609211417.42724.mb-list@adfinis.ch>

Hi,

Is there a possibility to add a condition to an event _before_ the ajax 
function will be called? Something like an effect, but before. 

instead of (event after):

onkeyup="__ydfsearchOnrp(__ydfgetonrp_search());document.getElementById(&quot;_main_onrp_search&quot;).focus();"

something like this (event before);

onkeyup="if(foo) { return false; }; __ydfsearchOnrp(__ydfgetonrp_search());"

For example, I have a search field, but to not overload server I only want the 
event to be executed when the length of the value is below 3 characters.

Thanks,
Matthias

  Hi,

I just found that you can do this by assigning the event attribute whenthe form element is created. Such as in this example:

            // add a button to the form
            $this->form->addElement('button', 'mybutton','Process the Form', array( 'onclick' => 'var x= false; if(!x) { alert(1); return false; }' ) );

            // add an event for 'mybutton'
            $this->ajax->addEvent( 'mybutton', array( &$this, 'processform' ), 'myform' );            

This has the effect of including javascript of the form:

	onclick="var x = false; if(!x) { alert(1); return false; };__ydfprocessform(xajax.getFormValues('myform'));"
This is basically what you are looking for. You can see how this worksif you look at the last 10 lines of the code for YDAjax::addEvent. Thismethod basically checks if there is some JS already assigned to theevent of the form element and adds its magic afterwards.

Regards,

Graeme

Yes, that's right.. and, btw, you can prepend events too, eg:


$this->form->addElement('button', 'mybutton', 'Process the Form', array( 
'onclick' => '...' ) );

$this->ajax->addEvent( 'mybutton', array( & $this,'processform' ), 
'myform', null, 'prepend' );

I forgot to add an example about it.. sorry.. i will :)

Look at this example:

class C{

	
	function C(){...}

	function actionDefault(){

		// create an hardcoded js function
		$this->ajax->addEvent( 'close()', array( &$this, 'doClose' ) );

		// create a default event
		$this->ajax->addEvent( '*',       array( &$this, 'dodefault' ) );
	}


	// this is the response of 'close()'
	function doClose(){
		...
		$this->ajax->returnResults();
	}


	// this is the functon that is executed for _other_ events
	function dodefault(){

		// get Javascript function and arguments
		list( $func_name, $func_args ) = func_get_args();

		// so something
		...


		$this->ajax->returnResults();
	}

}



I hope that you have understood.. if not.. just wait to see the example 
and then (with the generated code in the client) you will understand.

I have an application built 100% with your idea ;) and i can tell you 
that it works very well. All forms (and correspondent events for it) are 
generated on the response side ;)

Well.. the security must be checked on the server side. If you are 
trying to use * on addEvent you should check the function name and 
arguments syntax, if they really exists.. etc.. but you can control that.

  Hi Francisco,

First of all, I've seen your app and it looks really great ;-) . Itdemonstrates the real power of YDFramework and YDAjax.

Every time I have tried to use addEvent in a response the resultingjavascript that was added was __ydfarray() (or something similar). Thisis when I try to use the syntax:

     $this->ajax->addEvent( 'my_modal_button', array( &$this, 'processmodal' ), 'my_modal' )

in the response. To get this to work I have had to modifyYDAjax::computeFunction so that in a response it calls"registerFunction" and had to change the PHP generating the js code forresponses so that $serverFunction[1] is used instead of $serverFunction.

Please tell me if my interpretation of how to do this is totallyincorrect. I'd also appreciate it if you could explain how to correctlycreate a form in a response and add events to it.

Thanks,

Graeme

 Hello,

     Can an array be a parameter to getRecordsAsSet insteed of a sql
query ?

     $records =  The list of records as an array (ie generated from
getRecords())

     Now
    
     $recordSet =
$this->db->getRecordsAsSet($records,$this->page,$this->size);

     gives the following error
   
    Fatal error:  [1064] You have an error in your SQL syntax.  Check
the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right
syntax to use near 'Array' at line 1 in
D:\phpwork\vortex\YDFramework2\YDClasses\YDDatabase.php on line 1364

    but if I use the sql query insteed of $records it works fine.

No, the arguments of the getRecordsAsSet function cannot be an array. It's
only purpose is to return the result as a recordset.

If you are starting from an array, you need to instantiate the YDRecordSet
class manually like this:

$recordset = new YDRecordSet( $array );
