Subject: [ydf-users] mod_rewrite and recordsets
Message-ID: <BF854489-E8A8-418A-BF90-D30E95E8C522@gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've got a mod_rewrite rule that reads as follows:
RewriteRule ^[Cc]atalogue/[Rr]eadywear/([A-Za-z_-]+)/([A-Za-z_-]+)/? 
$ /catalogue/index.php?cat=$1&sub_cat=$2 [L]

so I have links that looks like /Catalogue/Readywear/Neckties/Silk/  
or /Catalogue/Readywear/Shirts/Button_Down/


the problem I have is that If I introduce a recordset into the  
equation the links generated by YDRecordset with {$highlights- 
 >getNextUrl()} look something like: /Catalogue/Readywear/Neckties/ 
Silk/?page=2&size=4 which seems to mangle the whole rewrite rule and  
renders the pagination inactive.

Do you have any suggestions as to how achieve clean urls whilst  
retaining the recordset functionality, something like:

/Catalogue/Readywear/Neckties/Silk/2/4/


any other possible solutions are also welcome.

many thanks.

Message-ID: <93778d790612061538x349dae0h3f15b25c97d04901@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guyz!

I just discover this on my code:

                $form->addElement( 'password','password','New
Password',$attributes_1 );
                $form->addElement( 'password','rpassword','Confirm
password',$attributes_1 );
                 ....

                $form->addRule( 'password',  'required','Password
field is required in this form!');
                $form->addRule( 'rpassword', 'required','Confirm
Password field is required in this form!');

When those two fields' values won't matched after hitting submit
button, definitely it will post an error message. But what I don't
like is that, let's say for example,

            <input style="width: 200px" id="registration_password"
type="password" name="registration_password" value="admin" />
            <input style="width: 200px" id="registration_rpassword"
type="password" name="registration_rpassword" value="aamin" />

you see that the value="aamin"  and value="aamin" is there. What I
expect to happen is after hitting submit button, values for passwod
field must be cleared out. I guess, its a bad idea if we let our
password remain visible to somebody. Just concern of security risk.
Can we make it to autmomatically clear this thing after hitting submit
button?

Cheers!

toytoy

Hi there!

I guess you have to include those get method variable's page and size
your rewrite rule if i'm not mistaken. Something like,
RewriteRule ^[Cc]atalogue/[Rr]eadywear/([A-Za-z_-]+)/([A-Za-z_-]+)/([\d])/([\d])?
$ /catalogue/index.php?cat=$1&sub_cat=$2&page=$3&size=$4
I don't think so my rewrite rule is right, but just get the point of
what I am trying to say!

Cheers,
toytoy

I think the best approach is to subclass YDRecordSet and reimplement the
methods to return the URLs.

Pieter, thanks for the pointer I ended up doing a couple of tricks in  
smarty. Will look into subclassing.

many thanks.

Hello,

I had the same problem, I solved it with adding at the end of the 
rewrite code :
&%{QUERY_STRING}

so the code is for exemple : rewiteRule ^test/(.*-([0-9]*)\.htm$ 
index.php?node=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [L]

Like that, it adds the others "GET" values at the end of the request, 
and it works with the "page" and "size" parameters.

Good luck

Laurent

Subject: [ydf-users] Suggested YDFramework Commenting and Code Structure
Message-ID: <93778d790612282118l140c39deh4785cc2d3c1e61c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guyz,

Though I may not be good with it, but I really think we have a proper
structure or ethics of our scripts. How the way we code, how we can
properly structure it. The thing here is that, I notice from
YDFramework website, there's nothing more about this. I guess its a
nice thing if we people have mind structure, I guess it would be great
also to have our code have structure and character.

Kindly correct me, suggest anything that would be really good and
perfect for our needs using this YDFramework. I hope it helps and I
hope it would be formalized and started.



- indention must always be set to four (4) spaces
 ex. php code
switch (condition) {
	case 1: {
        	action1;
        	break;
    	}
    	case 2: {
        	action2;
        	break;
    	}
    	default: {
        	defaultaction;
        	break;
    	}
}

ex. template code
<table>
	{if $required}
		{foreach from=$fields->set item="loop"}
			<tr>
				... anything...                                 	
			</tr>
		{/foreach}
	{/if}
</table>

- every methods of a class must have a two (2) lines of indention,
above and below
- YDInclude('YDF2_process.php'); must be after the line of the closing
brace of the class

class A
{


     method 1(){

     }


     // Short comment
     method 2(){

     }


}
YDInclude('YDF2_process.php');

- if an if statement contains only one (1) statement, always separate
them with a new line
  		ex.
		    if( $a_obj )
		        $res = $obj_resetpass->sendMail( $a_obj );
		    else
		        $linkid = '';
- variable declaration must always be easy for perusal
		ex.		
			$qlid 			= 	$this->_get( "qlid" );		
			$linkid 			= 	isset( $_GET['linkid'] ) ? trim( $_GET['linkid'] ) : '';
			$this->blocks		=	new blocks( array('login'),array() );
			
			
			$fields			= 	array(
							       "realname" 	=> 	$u_realname,
							       "mail" 		=> 	$u_email,
							       "username" 	=> 	$u_username,
							       "password" 	=> 	$u_password2,
							       "phone"		=>	$u_phone			
			) + $fields;
	Note: Always indent one (1) space when using a non-empty methods or
functions or statements that might use a parenthesis. ex. $this->_get(
"qlid" );
	Note: declaring an associative array, after the opening parenthesis,
a key of must not be parallel with the "array(" word, but must be one
space after should be paralleled.
	      ex. (bad)	
			$fields			= 	array(
							     "realname" 	=> 	$u_realname,
							     "mail" 		=> 	$u_email,
							     "username" 	=> 	$u_username,
							     "password" 	=> 	$u_password2,
							     "phone"		=>	$u_phone			
			) + $fields;
			
		ex. (good)
			$fields			= 	array(
							       "realname" 	=> 	$u_realname,
							       "mail" 		=> 	$u_email,
							       "username" 	=> 	$u_username,
							       "password" 	=> 	$u_password2,
							       "phone"		=>	$u_phone			
			) + $fields;
- declaring variables, calling a non-returning variable methods or
functions or executing an anonymous
  functions, since they are having different processes, always use
carriage return as its indention.
		  ex.
		  	
		$password	=	$fields['password'];
		$email 		= 	$this->db->escape( $fields['mail'] );
		
		$this->_getAllValues();
		
		if( $small > $big ){
			$p	= "pass";
			
			$processPee();
		}else{
			$p	= "stop";
			
			$processPee();			
		}
- using brackets within a function, open bracket must be after the
close parenthesis or use the UNIX convention
	ex.
		function sendEmail($fields){
		(not)
		function sendEmail($fields)
		{
- coding under the realms of if statement, after making a condition,
it must have no carriage return available as its indention. This is
because, if an if condition consists of only one (1) statement, so
	ex.
		(good)
		if( $big < $small ){
		   // No carriage return available above
		   // Here's what I'm going to do
		
		
		   //Ending my code
		   // No carriage return available below
		}
		
		(wrong)
		if( $big < $small ){
		
		   // Here's what I'm going to do
		
		   // Ending my code

- allowed style of comments are only C++ (/* */) and C's (//) are only
acceptable.
  Using perl/shell style comments (#)  are prohibited

- For files/scripts that have been changed since the script was fork,
the following header should be used:
/**
 *
 * brief description.
 * long description.  more long description.
 *
 * Portions Copyright 1999-2001 (c) VA Linux Systems
 * The rest Copyright 2002 (c) their respective authors
 *
 * @version   $Id: coding_standards.html,v 1.3 2001/05/17 17:19:37
authors_initalis Exp $
 *
 */


- for function/method/property comments,  this must be followed
/**
 * brief description.
 * long description.  more long description.
 *
 * @author    firstname lastname email
 * @param     variable  description
 * @return    value     description
 * @date      YYYY-MM-DD
 * @deprecated
 * @see
 *
 */


- Expressions

    * Use parentheses liberally to resolve ambiguity.
    * Using parentheses can force an order of evaluation. This saves
the time a reader may spend remembering precedence of operators.
    * Don't sacrifice clarity for cleverness.
    * Write conditional expressions so that they read naturally aloud.
    * Sometimes eliminating a not operator (!) will make an expression
more understandable.
    * Keep each line simple.
    * The ternary operator (x ? 1 : 2) usually indicates too much code
on one line. if... else if... else is usually more readable.

- Functions

Function Calls

Functions shall be called with 1 space between the function name, the
opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between commas
and each parameter, and 1 space between the last parameter, the
closing parenthesis, and the semicolon. Here's an example:

$var = foo( $bar, $baz, $quux );

Arguments with default values go at the end of the argument list and
must have 1 space before and after the equal (=) sign. Always attempt
to return a meaningful value from a function if one is appropriate.
Here is a slightly longer example:

function connect( &$dsn, $persistent = false ) {

    if ( is_array( $dsn ) ) {
        $dsninfo = &$dsn;
    } else {
        YDDebugUtil::dump($dsn);
    }

    return true;

}


- Scripts/Files Structure = Any suggestion?

Hi guyz,

Just a note, i notice that it doesn't view here correctly like this code:

                       $fields                 =       array(
                                                              "realname"
  =>      $u_realname,
                                                              "mail"
  =>      $u_email,
                                                              "username"
  =>      $u_username,
                                                              "password"
  =>      $u_password2,
                                                              "phone"
   =>      $u_phone
                       ) + $fields;
I forgot to note that It would be likable for us to use Mono type fonts,
such as Monospace or Courier to have same font-width for all code. Try to
copy and paste it using those fonts I mentioned, it would be aligned when it
be viewed.

- Fonts : Mono type fonts, such as Monospace, Courier, or others.

Hi guyz,

Just a note, i notice that it doesn't view here correctly like this code:

                       $fields                 =       array(
                                                              "realname"
  =>      $u_realname,
                                                              "mail"
  =>      $u_email,
                                                              "username"
  =>      $u_username,
                                                              "password"
  =>      $u_password2,
                                                              "phone"
   =>      $u_phone
                       ) + $fields;
I forgot to note that It would be likable for us to use Mono type fonts,
such as Monospace or Courier to have same font-width for all code. Try to
copy and paste it using those fonts I mentioned, it would be aligned when it
be viewed.

- Fonts : Mono type fonts, such as Monospace, Courier, or others.
