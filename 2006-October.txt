Subject: [ydf-users] YDAJax::addEvent( "*",
	... ) and adding events in a response
Message-ID: <20061003153253.66429.qmail@web54002.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi Francisco,

I am having a great deal of trouble trying to work out
how to correctly 
generate the events and forms in the YDAjax response.

The result that I am getting is that _everything_ is
processed by the 
catchAll event and there are not arguments such as the
name of the 
calling function passed (the only data I get is the
form contents). In 
my "catch all" function I have no basis for
determining what function to 
call to process the specific event (their are no
parameters that tell me 
the function / event / element id, etc).

When I tried to set up a close() event, the javascript
was generated but 
the desired PHP function was not called.

Thanks,

Graeme

Hello,

    Can the template variable  {YD_ACTION}  be changed.

    (ie)

    Currently the script is on  actionEdit, On clicking the update
button I am validating the form and updating the database and again I
need to display a message called "Sucesssfully Updated" 
so my tpl will be like this

   .(tpl)

    {if $YD_ACTION == 'edit'}
        displayed all the values that need to be edited 
            
    {/if}

     
    {if $YD_ACTION == 'update'}
   
      Successfully updated Click here to continue.
   
    {/if}
     
  (.php)

     function acionEdit()
     {

         if($this->form->validate())
         {
                  
              executeUpdate();
              $this->forward('update');
              return;
  
         }
     }
      
     function actionUpdate()
     {

         $this->template->display(); 
     } 


     Every Thing works fine 
     My Question is insteed of [ $this->forward('update') ] can I set
the value   to {YD_ACTION}

Someone here?

Things were better when there was a forum btw.

Anyway what's the roadmap for the weblog? I miss a plugin interface and
rss import. Anyone working on this?

Hi Rene,

no, there's no roadmap unfortunately for the weblog application.

Feel free to log these items as feature requests on berlios.de.

By the way, I will have to put the Yellow Duck Framework on low maintenance
till the end of the year as I'm travelling for work about 4 days a week...

If someone feels free to take over the lead, feel free to stand up!

Cheers,


pieter

Hi Moses,

the forward action actually takes care of updating the references to
YD_ACTION and also calls the action handler.

It's the preferred way to do what you are looking for.

cheers,

Hi Guys,

I just found out that on http://ydframework.berlios.de, there's no manual
for the coding standards produce on it. I think it would be likely easy for
us if we have a set of ethics on our code so if we would have a system made
and powered by Yellow Duck, it would be easy for those wanna-be's to
edit/modify the code according to the standards we have followed. Is this
possible for us to have this kind of stuff? What do you think?

Sure.. why not.. Maybe you could start by enumerating some ideas?

Hi Francisco, thanks for the compliance! I will do this part and post those
practice I have accumulated  which I also follow some of the PHPDoc/JavaDoc
styles and mix with arbitrarian concepts. Anyway, as soon as I could post
it, I hope we can collaborate, YD users, so that we can have a unity of
standards for our codes.

Paul Aga
