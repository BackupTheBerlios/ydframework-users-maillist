Subject: [ydf-users] Ignore blocks in Smarty
Message-ID: <442E9ADE.7070001@fusemail.com>

Hi all

I'm looking to Smarty manual but i can't find what i want.

Is it possible to define a block that Smarty must _not_ parse?

Eg, something like:

<html>
<head>
{ignore}
  <xpto>
{/ignore}
  <title>hi</title>
...

that would output:

<html>
<head>
  <title>hi</title>
...

Francisco A

kind regards

Btw, maybe we could define some "special" separators like: 'v' and 'h' 
(for vertical and horizontal).
This means that:

$form->addElement( 'checkboxgroup', 'name', 'label', array('separator' 
=> 'v'), array( 0 => 'choice 1', 1 => 'choice 2' ) );

.. will be the same as:

$form->addElement( 'checkboxgroup', 'name', 'label', array('separator' 
=> '<br />'), array( 0 => 'choice 1', 1 => 'choice 2' ) );


_AND_



$form->addElement( 'checkboxgroup', 'name', 'label', array('separator' 
=> 'h'), array( 0 => 'choice 1', 1 => 'choice 2' ) );

.. will be the same as:

$form->addElement( 'checkboxgroup', 'name', 'label', array('separator' 
=> '&nbsp;&nbsp;'), array( 0 => 'choice 1', 1 => 'choice 2' ) );


Cool hein? ;)

hi,

I change the line 64 in examples/ajax/waiting.php with :

$this->ajax->addResult('myspanresult', 'test<p class="aaa">test with
class</p>');

And when I see result with FireFox / Web Developper AddOn and show Id
& Class Details, it's look like this name class is .\"aaa\" instead of
.aaa

How to fix this, use template ?

thx

I didn't get any problems with your example using the latest YDAjax release.

What's your FF version?

Your example is working in IE?

Can you test the _new_ YDAjax waiting message example (build 1836)?

On FF and IE please.

another sample :

$this->ajax->addResult('myspanresult', '<table><tr
bgcolor="#ffcccc"><td>' . YD_FW_NAMEVERS . '</td></tr></table>');

don't work, but :

$this->ajax->addResult('myspanresult', '<table><tr
bgcolor=#ffcccc><td>' . YD_FW_NAMEVERS . '</td></tr></table>');

work fine.
It's a problem with quotes, no ?

Yes, it seems so. Can you try with latest build _1841_ ?

No problem. It's fixed. The problem was on the span js function that had 
the addslashes primitive too.

Hi moses

The difference between those declarations is that you will get "special" 
methods related to installations in the second declaration.
Extending YDInstaller is only usefull when you need that methods 
otherwise we will get the same as the first declaration but with poor 
performance..

Hi Moses,

unfortunately, this will not work with Smarty templates. The problem has to
do with the fact that Smarty is getting confused with the syntax of
"field[x]".

cheers,

hi all,
i was wondering if it's possible to create your
"templates" that controls the html output in above
method? I would like to have the label in one <td> and
the textfield in another. Is that possible? Or is the
best way to use toArray and then loop it out in the
template?

You can customize this by subclassing the YDFormRenderer_html class (in
YDFramework2/YDClasses/YDFormRenderers).

Once you have a custom version, you need to register it using
YDForm::registerRenderer to let the YDForm class know that there is an
additional renderer.

To render the form then to a string, you can use YDForm::render(
<name_of_renderer> );

cheers,

Hi Moses,

the difference is not that difficult:

1. setDefault: sets the value of a specific element

2. setDefaults: sets the value of multiple elements in one go using an
associative array

3. setRawDefaults: I'm not really sure what the meaning of this one is.
Maybe Francisco or db can enlighten you on this one.

regards,


pieter

So, if I understand it correctly, you want each record to show up in a
different form field, right?

If yes, then there are some things you need to change in the logic:

1. Get all the records from the database

2. Create a new form object

3. Create a new element for each record in the database, giving each one of
them a unique name

4. Assign the form to the template

5. Loop over the elements in the template to make them visible.

Regards,


pieter

setRawDefaults was an idea of setting and getting a form element value in a
different way, but is actually not being used.

An example: suppose there is a form element called 'comma'.

class comma extends YDFormElement {

  ...

 function setRawValue( $value='' ) {
   $arr = explode( ',', $value );
   $this->setValue( $arr );
 }

 function setValue( $value=array() ) {
   $this->_value = $value;
 }

 function getRawValue() {
   return implode( ',', $this->getValue() );
 }

}

The idea is to receive a value directly from a database, for example, that
is a comma separatted string an use setRawValue to transform it into an
array to be used in the class. The good thing is getting it back as a raw
value using getRawValue so you don't have to transform it into an array in
your code.

This is the main usage. Another example, if you get the value from a date
element you receive an array with the value for year, month, day, etc. But
we could create a getRawValue function that would directly transform it to a
DATETIME sql type YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, for example.

It's a nice idea, but I think complicates the form usage and is not being
used by the framework or by myself. Maybe we could think of taking it out.

If we don't use it, we should take it out. Having it there not being used is
only going to make it more confusing.

Hi moses

What you want is possible with YDF. Btw, there's more than one way to do 
it.. it only depends on your structure. Just use your imagination ;)

There is _not_ a method to do such thing but.. i'm thinking about a way 
that can work.

- Create a form for those text boxes only.

- add text elements (with different name) to that form
   foreach (  ...  ){ $form2->addElement( 'text', 'name_' . $i , ... ) }

- assign the form Object with YDTemplate::assign and _not_ 
YDTemplate::assignForm  (to use form methods on the template side)

- on the template side, get form elements, cycle them and render each one.


I didn't tryed that .. but seems to work .. Pieter, David ?

Btw, don't use "document.all" on javascript because that's IE specific 
code and will not work well on other browsers.

hi pieter,
thanks for your reply. however i can't seem to get it
to work completely. i've subclassed the
YDFormRenderer_html class and added it with
$this->form->registerRenderer('test',
'MyFormRenderer_html', 'MyFormRenderer_html.php')
(YDForm::registerRenderer doesnt work). It seems to
load the renderer alright but when i do
$this->form->render('test') it doesnt select my
renderer but the default one (YDForm::render() doesnt
work either).

am i missing something?
thanks.

Hi all!

When i load the cms example (example/cms/index.php) my server says :

Fatal error: Unknown database 'ydcms' in
[...]\YDFramework2\YDClasses\YDDatabase.php on line 1466

in order to try this example, can you please tell me the way i have to
do things?

kind regards

Poi,

the cms directory in the examples folder is not the new CMS framework
Francisco is adding as we speak. It's my own attempt to a CMS application,
but it's not really working good and will eventually be replaced with what
Francisco is building now.

I will actually take it out again to remove the confusion.

Subject: [ydf-users] YDCM Error handling
Message-ID: <444CFB1D.4060102@fusemail.com>

Hi all

We have already discussed error handling in YDF. The YDCM structure is 
not easy and we really need some error handling stuff because some 
methods can return lots of different error types and not only the 
correct value.

Because this structure is in the begging, i propose to add error 
handling.. and YDError seems a valid choice.

What do you think?

I agree that this would indeed be the best way of working. We have the
YDError class already, so we better start using it.

There's a mistake in your logic of looping over the fields. You basically
loop over all the form elements and properties, which is not what you wanted
to do. You need to add an extra check that checks either the prefix of the
field or the name or the type of the field.
