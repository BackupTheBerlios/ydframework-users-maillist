<PRE>From: Mrs. Sylvia Mensah
Accra, Ghana. 

Hello Dear

I got your contact during my search for a reliable,honest and a trust
 worth person to entrust this huge transfer project with 

My name is Mrs.Sylvia Mensah, Branch manager of a financial institution here in Ghana. I am a Ghanaian married with two kids.  

I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of $7,597.864.00 Million United States dollars only. This fund is the excess of what
 my branch in which am the manager made as profit during the 2005 financial year. 

I have already submitted annual report for that year to my head office here in Accra Ghana as I have watched with keen interest as they will
 never know of this excess

I have since, placed this amount of $ 7,597.864.00 Million United States dollars only to an Escrow Coded account without a beneficiary
 (anonymous) to avoid trace
 
As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money due to civil service code which formits civil servants from owing or
 operating foreign currency account coupled with the fact that the fund is huge thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive
 this money into your bank account on my behalf
 
I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this.
 It's going to be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund so that the fund can be
 legally processed to your name and be transferred to your account.

If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response to my private email:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ydframework-users">sylviamensah1 at myway.com</A> or Send SMS message to this phone
 line : 00233-24-609-1514

With Regards,

Mrs. Sylvia Mensah
