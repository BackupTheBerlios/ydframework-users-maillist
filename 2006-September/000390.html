<PRE>  Hi Francisco,

First of all, I've seen your app and it looks really great ;-) . Itdemonstrates the real power of YDFramework and YDAjax.

I hope that you have understood.. if not.. just wait to see the example and then (with the generated code in the client) you will understand.  
I managed to get a simple piece of code working last night but itdidn't process any arguments. Your example gives me some idea of what ineed to do with respect to using func_get_args().
      
I am also trying to find out how to generate a form in a response and whether addEvent can be used in the response. My reason for wanting to create a form in a response is that I am trying to work out a technique for creating modal forms that popup within the existing page and behave like modal dialog boxes.I could pre-create the modal forms in the request and hide them but I think this could have security implications ...    
    
I have an application built 100% with your idea ;) and i can tell you that it works very well. All forms (and correspondent events for it) are generated on the response side ;)Well.. the security must be checked on the server side. If you are trying to use * on addEvent you should check the function name and arguments syntax, if they really exists.. etc.. but you can control that.

Every time I have tried to use addEvent in a response the resultingjavascript that was added was __ydfarray() (or something similar). Thisis when I try to use the syntax:

     $this-&gt;ajax-&gt;addEvent( 'my_modal_button', array( &amp;$this, 'processmodal' ), 'my_modal' )

in the response. To get this to work I have had to modifyYDAjax::computeFunction so that in a response it calls&quot;registerFunction&quot; and had to change the PHP generating the js code forresponses so that $serverFunction[1] is used instead of $serverFunction.

Please tell me if my interpretation of how to do this is totallyincorrect. I'd also appreciate it if you could explain how to correctlycreate a form in a response and add events to it.

Thanks,

Graeme
