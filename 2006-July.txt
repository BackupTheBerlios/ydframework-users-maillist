Subject: [ydf-users] YDDatabaseObject - What's the right way to do ?
Message-ID: <44A7AFCC.60408@free.fr>

Hi all,
Here is something I'd like to do with the YDDatabaseObject but I cannot
find the right way to do.
In the YDDO examples provided with the framework, there's always
multiple rows associated to one object. I mean, a user can have multiple
phone numbers and can be associated with multiple groups. I know that in
this case the phone number row is associated to one and only one user,
but how should I consider a row that can be associated to "one" other
row, many times. I mean for example an object which can be in one place
and associated with one state, of which labels and other valuable
information would be in other tables ? I hope it'll be more
understandable with the detailled example, if not let me know :

Objects table :
idobject-name-idstate-idplace
1-one hammer-1-2
2-Swiss knive-1-1
3-one other hammer-2-2

States table :
idstate-label-and other valuable attributes...
---------------------
1-new-...
2-in good condition-...
3-word-...

Places table :
idplace- label-and other valuable attributes...
---------------------
1-kitchen-...
2-cellar-...

I'd like to be able to write something like :
$object->id = 1;
$object->find('state', 'place');
 in order to retrieve :
$object->id = 1
$object->label->one hammer
$object->state_id =1
$object->state_label =new
$object->place_id = 2
$object->place_label = cellar

I thought first I could reuse the phone relationship example, with an
INNER join association, but I don't succeed and it breaks my head since
two days. The best I'have made is to retrieve the object with a
$object->find('state', 'place'), but the inner joins are not made on the
proper key.
I can handle it with a multiple relationship and an intermediate table
of mapping like the user_group provided example, with a single
association row, but before using this way I'd like to know if I miss
something.
Any pieces of information would be appreciated,
Many thanks,

Erwan.

Hi Graeme

That grid is an experiment. I started creating it to a project but i 
have stopped.
The idea was just to create a table with headers that have ajax calls 
for sorting and some spans for pagination.

That was a feature i wanted too.. but it's not trivial. The grid is a 
basically a form, and i wanted to be able to extend that form with some 
elements (eg, to be able to filter).

But as i said .. it's only experimental.

resetQuery() didn't work.. but resetAll() worked. :)

Thanks anyway.

What you are doing looks right. Be sure to register the relation correctly.

    class object extends YDDatabaseObject {
        function object() {
            $this->YDDatabaseObject();

            $this->registerKey( 'id' );
            $this->registerField( 'name' );
            $this->registerField( 'idstate' );
            $this->registerField( 'idplace' );

            $rel = & $this->registerRelation( 'state', false, 'state' );
            $rel->setForeignJoin( 'INNER' );
            $rel->setLocalKey( 'idstate' ); // it's not the primary key of
object
            $rel->setForeignKey( 'id' );

            $rel = & $this->registerRelation( 'place', false, 'place' );
            $rel->setForeignJoin( 'INNER' );
            $rel->setLocalKey( 'idplace' ); // it's not the primary key of
object
            $rel->setForeignKey( 'id' );
        }
    }

So if you have:

$obj = YDDatabaseObject::getInstance( 'object' );
$obj->id = 1;
$obj->find( 'state', 'place' );

After this you will have:

$obj->id = 1;
$obj->name = 'one hammer';
$obj->idstate = 1;
$obj->idplace = 2;
$obj->state->id = 1;
$obj->state->label = 'new';
$obj->place->id = 2;
$obj->place->label = 'cellar';

If you use getValues to retrieve an array you'll have:

array(
  'id' => 1,
  'name' => 'one hammer';
  'idstate' => 1,
  'idplace' => 2,
  'state_id' => 1,
  'state_label' => 'new',
  'place_id' => 2,
  'place_label' => 'cellar'
);

Hi Francisco,

Thanks for the clarification. I'm glad I only spent a
few minutes trying 
it out.

I'll see if I can manually setup recordset
manipulation in my forms. 
Basically I wanted a table with buttons in each row
that I could use to 
move rows up and down through a table. YDAjax is not
too difficult to 
use once you get the hang of it.

Thanks,

Graeme

I'll try to create an example of how to use the ajax "grid". Maybe your 
suggestion could be a good example.. the only problem i see is how to 
create those buttons, maybe hardcoding them (html) in the cell.

Hello Sir

         
     In my page I have a form and within that I have two submit buttons
named add,edit

     
$this->form->addElement('submit','add','Add',array("class"=>"button"));
     
$this->form->addElement('submit','edit','Edit',array("class"=>"button"));
     
    and I have two functions named

    function actionAdd
    {
            -- The Code --
    
    }  
 
   function actionEdit
   {

       -- The Code for Edit --
   } 


   So when I click add submit button the function actionAdd() should be
executed and when I click Edit the function actionEdit() should be
executed.

    
    What should I do...

regards 
moses

Hello Sir

   How to set Properties for a element  after it has  been created
  
    I add an text element to a form like this

          $this->form->addElement('text','timeInHrs','Time In','');

    After completing the processing I should disable the text 

    So in actionComplete

    Can I use the following coding

          $this->form->addElement('text','timeInHrs','Time
In',array("disabled"=>"disabled"));

    If so I have an doubt 
   
     In the same page if it possible to add two elements is it
correct!!!!!


    Is there any other way.

Use YDForm::getElement to get a reference to the element object and change
the $_attributes var.

$elm =& $this->form->getElement( 'timeInHrs' );
$elm->_attributes['disabled'] = 'disabled';

Well... this kind of behavior is not that simple because a form can have
only one action and that action can't be changed with javascript (I think).

I don't know a nice solution for it, but perhaps you could add a text field
called 'action' with style="display:none". Then with javascript when the
user presses the Add button, you fill the 'action' field with "add" and for
the Edit button, fill with "edit". In your php script you can now redirect
the request to the desired action.

Just a suggestion, someone knows a better way?

Hi

I think javascript enables you to do what you want.

You can create a HTML document like this one:
<header>
    ...
    <script type="text/javascript" src="foo.js"></script>
</header>
<body>
    ...
    <form id="myForm" action="" ...>
        ...
        <input id="addButton" type="button" value="Add" />
        <input id="editButton" type="button" value="Edit" />
        ...
    </form>
    ...
</body>

Then the foo.js file has to contain something like:
    window.onload = init();

    var addButton = null;
    var editButton = null;
    var myForm = null;

    function init() {
        myForm = document.getElementById('myForm');

        addButton = document.getElementById('addButton');
        addButton.onclick = function() {
            myForm.action = 'http://yourpage.html?do=add'; // or only
'?do=add' here
            myForm.submit();
        }

        editButton = document.getElementById('editButton');
        editButton.onclick = function() {
            myForm.action = 'http://yourpage.html?do=edit'; // or only
'?do=edit' here
            myForm.submit();
        }
    }

Well, I have not tested this code but I think it should work.
Kind regards

Hello Sir
 
      Thank U for your reply. 
   
      I didnt tried with javascript but I used the following coding

      if($_POST['form_add'])
      {
          $this->forward('add');
      }  
 
       if($_POST['form_edit'])
      {
          $this->forward('edit');
      } 
    
      One more question.   
      Now while creating a form we where specifing the action to the
form
      Is there any way to specify the action to be performed by the form
should given in the submit button. so that we can have any no of submit
buttons and actions.

regards
moses

In a lot of cases, there is no need for two separate actions for
insert/edit. What I generally tend to do, is to include the primary key as a
hidden field in the form. If there is no primary key, an insert needs to
happen, otherwise, an edit needs to happen.

Hello Sir

    On submiting the form the   action is page.php?do=submit 
  
   and in the function 

   function actionSubmit()    
   {
         1)I insert the values to the database 
         2)$this->forward('default');  

   }

   Every Thing works fine but

   Now I refreshes the form again the value is being again inserted to
the database 

   To avoid this I recode it   

  function actionSubmit()    
   {
         1)I insert the values to the database 
         2)header("Location: page.php");

   }  

   Now Works Fine

   Is there any other way Insteed of using header 
   $this->forward('--Some thing else --');


regards
moses

    The following code add one  attribute to the element timeInHrs 
  
    $elm =& $this->form->getElement( 'timeInHrs' );
    $elm->_attributes['disabled'] = 'disabled';

         
     As per my situation I need to disable a element then enable then
disable and goes on
     If I code like this 

     $elm->_attributes['disabled'] = ''; 
     $elm->_attributes['enabled'] = 'enabled'

     there is no use  
    
     Can u please tell me how to  remove an particular attribute from an
element

You have YDFormElement::delAttribute() for that too:


   $elm =& $this->form->getElement( 'timeInHrs' );
   $elm->delAttribute( 'disabled' );

Hello Sir

       I get two diffetrent outputs with different versions 
     
       The following is the code to creat a text 

       $this->form->addElement('text','txtFirstName','First
Name',array("class"=>"textbox"));

       The outputs are          

       For Version := Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 (build RC1) 

       the output is <div id = edit > <label
for="form_txtFirstName">First Name</label>  <input class="textbox"
type="text" name="form_txtFirstName" value="">   </div>


       For Version := Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 (build 2.0.0-final) 

       the output is <div id = edit > First Name  <input class="textbox"
id="form_txtFirstName" type="text" name="form_txtFirstName" value="" /> 
 </div>


       ie In the latest version there is no <label> tag for label 
Why... is there any reason for it

       What my problem is

       I am using css for label like this
 
       #edit .label
       {
          color:red;
      }    

       But in  the latest versions since there is no label tag I could
not get the Css Effect 

       Is there any alternatives or I should use only the older
versions.

moses

Hello Sir

       How to get the name of the elements that does not  satisify  the 
Rules  after submitting.

       In my form for two element I have given rules

           $this->form->addRule('firstName','required','First Name is
required');
	   $this->form->addRule('lastName','required','Last Name is required');
             
      While submitting the form I entered the only the  first name 
 
     So I get the error "Last Name is required"
   
     What I need is I also want to get the name of the element that does
not satisify the rule ie   lastName 

     $this->form->_errors will print the element and the rule
  
     But how to get the value of the element

     If I give   $this->form->_errors[0]  Since it is not a numerical
array  I got an error  
     
     Notice:  Undefined offset:  0 in D:\web\cuac\admin\admin.php on
line 62

Message-ID: <20060708033024.fe477b357a56c857c15a39baa2ae95d5.e77d57da03.wbe@email.secureserver.net>

Hello Sir

     How to add an attribute to a label tag.

     In my form I have added an element with label

     $this->form->addElement('text','firstName','First
Name',array("class"=>"textbox"));
     $this->form->addRule('firstName','required','First Name is
required');

     The html output is
   
     <label for="form_firstName">First Name</label> <input
class="textbox" type="text" name="form_firstName" value="">       

     Now I am submiting the form without entering the First Name So it
displays the error  First Name is required

     At this time what I need is 

     I want to add an attributte class = "error" in the label element ie
  <label for="form_firstName" class = "error">First Name</label>

     I tried with the folowing coding

     if ( sizeof( $this->form->_errors ) > 0 ) 
     {
        while(list($element)=each($this->form->_errors))
        {
	  $this->elmErr =& $this->form->getElement("$element");
          $this->elmErr->_label = '<label class = "error"
for="'.$this->form->_name.'_'.$element.'">'.$label.'</label>';
        }
     }


    Here the out put becomes

    <label for="form_firstName"><label for="form_firstName" class =
"error">First Name</label></label>  


    ie Two label element is being displayed

    How to avoid this or How to solve the problem

    Please Help


regards
moses

hi moses,
thanks for your help, all i actually had to do was:
if ( $this->form->isSubmitted()) {
    $element =&      
$this->form->getElement('num_poll_alt');
    unset($element->_value);
}

You must explicitly define where you want the label. In your template 
just define:

{$formName.text.label}{$formName.text.html}

this way your will get the label before the element itself.

Hello Sir

    I have defined explicitly as u said
   
    {$formName.text.label}{$formName.text.html}

     I am getting the Label output in my browser but the Html code
differs 
  
     ie in the latest version the Html output is  only the Label Name 
as a plain text 
     where in version  Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 (build RC1) the html
output  is Labelelement with label name
     ie <label for = "form_name"> Label name </label>

Hello Sir

    How to add an attribute to a label element.

    (.tpl)
          {$form.name.label}

     The Html is
          <label for = "form_name"> Name </label>

     Now I need to add an attribute class = "error" to the label

    ie   <label for = "form_name" class = "error"> Name </label>


    How to do so.

regards
moses   
  

For Detailed Reference



 In my form I have added an element with label

    $this->form->addElement('text','firstName','First
Name');
    $this->form->addRule('firstName','required','First Name is
required');

    The html output is
 
    <label for="form_firstName">First Name</label> <input
class="textbox" type="text" name="form_firstName" value="">      

    Now I am submiting the form without entering the First Name So it
displays the error  First Name is required

    At this time what I need is

    I want to add an attributte class = "error" in the label element ie
 <label for="form_firstName" class = "error">First Name</label>

    I tried with the folowing coding

    if ( sizeof( $this->form->_errors ) > 0 )
    {
       while(list($element)=each($this->form->_errors))
       {
 $this->elmErr =& $this->form->getElement("$element");
         $this->elmErr->_label = '<label class = "error"
for="'.$this->form->_name.'_'.$element.'">'.$label.'</label>';
       }
    }


   Here the out put becomes

   <label for="form_firstName"><label for="form_firstName" class =
"error">First Name</label></label>  


   ie Two label element is being displayed

   How to avoid this or How to solve the problem

Hello Sir

  I am not  trying to add an error msg to the form element.
  
  I want to know is it possible to add an attribute to the html label
element
  (ie)

  {$form.name.label}

  the above code generates the following html output

  <label for = "form_name">Name</label>

  Now I want to add one attribute class = "test" to the label element
         <label class = "test" for = "form_name">Name</label>

 Is it possible.

regards
moses

hi moses,
i could be wrong (and i guess somebody will correct me
if that's the case) but looking at the
YDFormRenderer_html.php it doesn't seem to support
that.
You could hack it a bit though and create your own
form renderer by doing:

$form->registerRenderer('whatever','MyRenderer',
'renderers/MyRenderer.php');	
$this->template->assign( 'form',
$form->render('whatever') );

hope that helps.

/dab

Why don't you define the label _inside_ a span? Maybe something like:

<span class="test"> {$form.name.label} </span>

Hi Francisco 

    Thanks for ur reply
     
    Why don't you define the label _inside_ a span? Maybe something
like: 
    <span class="test"> {$form.name.label} </span>

    Its a good idea but my situation is

    In my form I have several label and the corresponding textbox 

    While submitting the form if the user does not enter the value to
the text box I should change only the color of the  corresponding 
Label  of the textbox to red.

    If I could add a class within the label dynamically I could solve
the problem.

 moses
   
  I need to change the color of the label to red

Sure.. with Yellow Duck Framework you can do it easily ;)


Instead of:

<span class="test"> {$form.name.label} </span>




You just need:

{if ($form.errors.name)} <span 
style="color:#FF0000">{$form.name.label_html}</span>
{else} {$form.name.label_html} {/if}

Message-ID: <fbd383e30607262203la665cc0h27f52808a247c6aa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everybody

     I have created three radio buttons

     $this->form->addElement('radio','reason','','',array
("tea"=>"Tea","lunch"=>"Lunch","Other"=>"other"));

    To hide this buttons dynamically I did the following:
    $this->elm_reason =& $this->form->getElement('reason');
    $this->elm_reason->_attributes["class"] ="hidden";

   where the css contains
  .hidden
  {
     visibility:hidden;
  }

   I works fine  the option buttons is not visible, but the problem is label
for the option button is being displayed

  (ie)  (Tea,Lunch,Other) is being displayed

  How to avoid this.
  Is there any other way to hide the elements

  Note:
          I am moses, previously I used the mail moses at softwaysolutions.com.
Since I coulnd not use that Id further  here after I will be posting
messages with the following mail mosesdinakaran at gmail.com

 Thanks&Regards
 moses

Hi all

       Is it possible to return values from a forms addRule function()

  (ie)
   I have Created a function to check the values of the form after it has
been submitted.

           $this->form->addFormRule(array($this,'validateTimings'));

   in that function i have a variable called name

  function validateTimings($fields)
{

      $this->name = "Moses";
      return true;
 }

  I

 function actionDefault()
{

      if($this->form->validate())
     {
        echo "Name:=".$this->name;

     }
}

  When I try to print the variable I get the error Undefined Variable


   How to solve the problem

regards
moses

Afaik, addFormRule must return:
- boolean true, if rule is passed
- array( $errorMessage ), if rule do not pass

*Hi Francisco*
**
*          *Thanks for ur reply, still my doubt is not cleared.

          In a function if we declare a variable as $this it becoms global
so that we can access it from any functions.

*           *But in the addFormRule function() Though  I decalre a variable
as $this I could not access the variable outside the function.

           Is there any restriction that the  addFormRule function() will
only return either true nor
array( $errorMessage ) and we cannot access its variables.

moses

Afaik no.. but it seems you are not trying to access variables inside 
the class because it seems you are cloning the object.
Can you try:

$this->form->addFormRule(array( & $this,'validateTimings'));

instead of:

$this->form->addFormRule(array($this,'validateTimings'));
