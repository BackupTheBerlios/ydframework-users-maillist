Hi all.

Yes, i'm starting the forum discussion (again). I don't know what is 
your opinion about the forum/mailinglist but i really like the forum 
experience. I remember why we have changed and the problems we had about 
the phpBB forum but i remember how different that was from this mailing 
list.

Nothing is better than a forum except the update/maintaining tasks and 
because of that i propose to give a personal contribution to this project.
My idea is to donate a one-year Invision Power Board hosting. Because no 
one is interested in maintaining a server and software, this seems the 
best option out there.. IP would host the forum and do all required updates.

What is your option about this?


regards
Francisco A

Hi Francisco,

This would be great if we would have a forum that we can let people view
topics by not subscribing to the mailing list and have our archives of
topics centralized.
IMHO, how about vBulletin instead of phpBB, though its not free but the
feature is great than the phpBB.

happy new year to all,
paul

phpBB is out. I prefer Invision Power Board instead of vBulletin because
they (IPB) handle all hosting and updating stuff.

Hi all,

after a long period of time, I decided to release Yellow Duck Framework and
Yellow Duck Weblog version 2.1 final.

Downloads are on:
http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3988

Cheers,

I'm just concerned about the continuity of this payable forum. As soon
as we go for it, we need to be able to pay for it each year...

Well.. maybe one step in first? Maybe someone would support it.. maybe i 
would support it.. maybe convert it.. maybe other option.. who knows 
what's gonna happen in the next year?

Anyway, my support remains.. Should we start a forum or not?

Are there any other (read: better) options than phpbb which we can host
ourselves on berlios?

What will happen with the mailing lists? Do you suggest to move completely
to a forum or do you want them to live side by side?

Afaik, all open solutions don't have full hosting/maintainance.. as they
are free.
All i know is that i personally don't want to manage/update servers/software.

I prefer like when we have the forum. Mailling lists would be good for svn.

One of the reasons I slowed my use of the ydf on my projects is
because our forum was taken to mailing list....
So "YES" we should have a forum... if we need to host a paid/nonpaid
board I can setup and host free (no limitations) , if you need someone
to set it up, I can do it. if you need someone to maintain the forum,
I also would do it without no problems...
I like the Idea of IPB.... but yes we need a forum!

Carlos,

a forum on there...

I still prefer a mailing list to be honest, but that's just my
personal taste of course...

hey Pieter, I kind of see your point of view,  since with my Dev team
that is what we use because we have to read each and all of them at
that exact time so we can reply asap..... But for user support and
other things we don't... we use a forum and look at it during the
weekend or on our free time...
Also the Styles on the forum help attract people instead of a usual
malling list with no a so user friendly interface.... some times lack
of advance search capabilities

That is just my point of view...

Mailing lists are expert-friendly :) .. forums are user-friendly (they 
have search, they have history, they are a good way to store feature 
requests, they help new-users with a organized content.)

Mailing lists are good to huge projects (eg: kde), they are threaded..

I propose to have both. Developers use both, users can choose.

What do you think?

Hi all !
Due to my java job I'm a little bit set back from the Yellow Duck, but
I'm still there....

I totally agree with you Francisco. It's easier and more attractive to
browse than a mailling list and (I hope) it could results in more
effective users of the framework. Perhaps the better would be to
"transform" the user-list in a forum and keep the dev-list.
Just my two euros cents...

Erwan.

So, let's start it..

Pieter, seems that there's no problem with you, right?

Carlos, do you have all berlios details? Can you install it (maybe with 
the old structure http://ydframework.berlios.de/forum/ )?

Hi guys,

It would really be easy for users and beginners to get resources from a
forum because they can view those public postings without logging in or
registering. However, I prefer mailing list for developers, but forum for
users and beginners who wants to learn more and discover some experiences
with other users of ydframework . Having a mailing list, we have to log-in
for our email account just to see emails from yellowduck framework, while in
forum we can view while not logging in and its categorized.

Maybe we can have some also a test for a year if having a forum is really
effective. I have also found on this site (
http://www.phpkitchen.com/index.php?/archives/669-PHP-Frameworks.html).
YDFramework is found on the "Interesting But Couldn't Find Reviews" section.
Hope having a forum can help to provide more reviews on it.

@Pieter: Release of YDFramework 2.1 is so great!!! Great great job!

regards,

paul toytoy

I really don't understand why we need a _week_ to discuss a simple topic.

Can we talk about _forum_to_choose_and_how_to_setup_it ?

Hi all,

if I read through the emails correctly, it seems that most people
favor http://www.simplemachines.org. I suggest we just go for it and
see how far we get.

On the other hand, are there people interested in writing some reviews
about the framework? I think we are now at a point where some
marketing could definitely help us forward.

If I look at what would be helpful if someone could take care of it,
then I would say:
- Somebody that takes care of announcing new releases to e.g.
freshmeat.net and other PHP interested websites
- Somebody that can take care of vamping up the documentation and help
writing some of the missing parts
- Someone that can help in looking forward and helping to find out
what PHP5 could help us improve on the framework and what other things
we should put in the pipeline.
- Someone that can take care of following up the bug reports and
feature requests

I'm still convinced we have a framework that is one of the better ones
written in PHP, but without a full blown team supporting it, we will
keep on being a small fish in the big sea...

cheers,


pieter

I experience this sometimes, but not everytime...
I have to say that I am often behind a proxy.

same here since Friday Pieter.., I even had to set it up through a
proxy since it was unreachable.....
if this keeps going like this I would not have a problem setting it up
on one of my servers :)
but I believe that is a temporary thing...

Hi guys,

I experience downtime too, and more often back then. I thought its one of
the problems beyond my end. However I notice it just as when YDF2.1 is
released, i got no downtime visiting on those said links.

Subject: [ydf-users] Multiple connection
Message-ID: <93778d790701221850x76e440cbw273bce78305f41c7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Just got a problem on how can i create multiple connections with YDDatabase.
My variables looks like these,


        $this->db =
YDDatabase::getInstance('mysql',$database,$username,$password,$host);
        $this->db2 =
YDDatabase::getInstance('mysql',$database2,$username,$password,$host);

Problem is that, when I use the $this->db, then after it I want to access
some table on $this->db2 which have different database name and tables, i
still got the connection inside the $this->db. Is there a way to do multiple
connection using YDDatabase or anything?

thanks,
paul

Hi Piete,

Having this example,

       $this->db =
YDDatabase::getInstance('mysql','db1','username','password','localhost');
       $this->db2 =
YDDatabase::getInstance('mysql','db2','username','password','localhost'

using those objects above will result just like this

               echo $this->db->getDatabase(); // prints db1
               echo $this->db2->connect(); // prints 1
               echo $this->db2->getDatabase(); // prints db2
               echo $this->db2->getRecord( "SELECT * FROM #_TEMP
WHERE t_sessid='{$_SESSION['t_sessid']}' LIMIT 1" );  // prefix for #
is tbl and it says table
db1.tbl_TEMP doesn't exist
               exit;

Note that, db1 has no tbl_TEMP, else db2 has it.

BUT:

               echo $this->db->getDatabase(); // prints db1
               echo $this->db2->connect(); // prints 1
               echo $this->db2->getDatabase(); // prints db2
               mysql_select_db( YDConfig::get( 'DATABASE2' ) ); //
set db in php's native convention, where YDConfig::get( 'DATABASE2' )
== 'db2'
               echo $this->db2->getRecord( "SELECT * FROM #_TEMP
WHERE t_sessid='{$_SESSION['t_sessid']}' LIMIT 1" );  // prints Array
in which I really expect
               YDDebugUtil::dump( $this->db2->getRecord( "SELECT * FROM #_TEMP
WHERE t_sessid='{$_SESSION['t_sessid']}' LIMIT 1" ) ); // Prints array
('t_sessid' => 't_45b6ced8808ca', 'name' => 'my name',
  'age' => '12', 'country' => 'phi',) which i really expect too
               exit;


Thanks for the reply piete!

paul
