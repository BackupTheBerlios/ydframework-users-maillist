<PRE>This has nothing to do with YDF as such, but since I'm using YDF for 
this project, and I know there are some bright minds reading these 
lists, I'll give it a shot...

I am building this inventory system for the company I work for, and I'm 
running into a wall. Hopefully one of you SQL gurus can help me out. 
This thing is (unfortunately) running on MS-SQL, so I can't use any of 
the YDF classes, but I do have views, stored procedures, triggers and 
what not. (if that would be needed)

I have this table with the folowing fields:
item, pallet, location, user, movedate

It will hold the location of each item and/or pallet (an item can be 
moved by itself, or as part of a pallet), who put it there, and when.

The tricky part is that there are no key fields. They are indexed for 
speed, but nothing is unique. The reason is that stuff moves around a 
lot, so an item can be moved several times a day, on and off a pallet, 
etc, etc... So this table holds the history of every move, ever 
performed on every item and pallet in the building. (Needless to say, 
it's gonna be a big one)

What I want is a subset of this table, with only the last entry for each 
item and pallet (not the history). Thus showing me every item and 
pallet, with it's *current* location, who put it there, and when.

Easier said than done, as I've been struggling with this all day, but 
can't get my head around it. I have to say, I'm not the best with SQL, 
just know the basics.

If anyone can give me an idea of how to build a query for this, I owe 
you my first born (well, almost)

Any help would be appriciated!
