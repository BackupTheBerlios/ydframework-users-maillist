<PRE>Hi all,

I wanted to share an idea with you about what I call a &quot;Content Management
Framework&quot;, which I might be adding to the framework.

Essentially, I would like to add a system that makes it easy to create a CMS
based on the Yellow Duck Framework by avoiding to have to do the same work
over and over again.

Most CMS systems work based on a tree of objects, which I find a good
approach. Since we have the YDDatabaseTree class, this is quite easy to do.
Additionally, every node on the tree could have a specific object type that
describes the different properties and defines some metadata about what
properties are required/optional, different constraints and possible custom
actions (more about this later).

The basic idea would be to create something like YDCmsContentTree that
allows you to query the database and get objects from the database in the
proper format (read: object type), which you can use in your templates.

On the other hand, since we know exactly what we can expect as properties
for each object, we can easily build the administration side of things in an
automated way, rather than having to do it manually.

Just to give an example:

- Home -&gt; YDRootNode
- Shop -&gt; YDShopNode
  - Product -&gt; YDShopProductNode
  - Category -&gt; YDShopCategoryNode
    - Product -&gt; YDShopProductNode
- News -&gt; YDNewsNode
  - News Item -&gt; YDNewsNode
  - News Item -&gt; YDNewsNode
- Gallery -&gt; YDGalleryNode
  - Photo Album -&gt; YDGalleryAlbumNode
    - Picture -&gt; YDGalleryPhotoNode
    - Picture -&gt; YDGalleryPhotoNode
This is how the tree would look like. For the administration part, some
content nodes might have additional (custom) actions, such as the
&quot;ActiveOrders&quot; action for the YDShopNode class, which would list the orders.

Deriving an actual CMS from that would be quite straightforward. You simply
instantiate the YDCmsContentTree and start defining all the objects and
their properties/constraints. All that is left then is to setup the
templates, and all the rest of the stuff happens automatically.

We can even make it that smart that the database schema gets
generated/updated automatically when instantiating the YDCmsContentTree. I
plan to make it even that intelligent to allow the content tree to be
instantiated in all the different database engines supported by the
framework. This will require us however to create a class that is able to
create database tables in a database independant way.

Later on, it should be quite easy to add extra features such as security and
permissions, authentication and so on.

The only thing I'm still not sure about is how we can integrate with
external pieces of software such as e.g. forum software (phpBB, MyBB, UseBB,
etc.). There should be a way to do it, but I still need to think how
exactly.

PS1: it would be very easy to apply this structure to e.g. the weblog
application.

PS2: multi-lingual sites should be supported from the start, as this is
often a requirement.

Any suggestions, additions, comments, remarks?

Regards,



pieter
