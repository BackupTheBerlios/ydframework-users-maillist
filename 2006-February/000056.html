<PRE>&gt;<i> I've already logged the neccessary feature requests for improved error 
</I>&gt;<i> handling and translations.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> For the errors, I plan to make a custom error handler that, depending on 
</I>&gt;<i> how you configure it, will do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> - If already defined, it will use that one (by means of a standard name)
</I>&gt;<i> - If not defined yet:
</I>&gt;<i>   - PHP4: will use trigger_error
</I>&gt;<i>   - PHP5: will throw an exception
</I>
Sorry but, are you talking about YDError internals? Or we will need to 
know if we are in a php4 or php5 environment?

&gt;<i> This way, we maintain backwards compatibility, while, if possible, 
</I>&gt;<i> taking advantage of the new features of PHP5. Since most people are 
</I>&gt;<i> still using PHP4 rather than PHP5 (unless you can prove me otherwise), 
</I>&gt;<i> this is the best we can do I guess.
</I>
Yes, this send us to a previous discussed topic about &quot;php5 only or not?&quot;.

&gt;<i> For the locale stuff, if we backport the translation stuff available in 
</I>&gt;<i> the weblog application, would that be sufficient you think? If not, can 
</I>&gt;<i> you enlighten me a little bit on what you would like to see added/changed?
</I>
Yes. Like db said, maybe integrate it with YDLocale could be better. 
Some remarks about that translation function are:
- make it the more fast (optimized) as possible as it will be called 
dozens of times..
- make it possible to handle custom arguments for dynamic values.
Another detail is maybe we should include the language file inside 
YDLocale::set(), this way YDLocale::t() will not try to include it every 
time...

&gt;<i> For the switch, eventually, we will need to do the switch anyway if we 
</I>&gt;<i> want to take full advantage of the new PHP 5 features.
</I>
That's a problem. I think we need to wait a little more. Php5 is not yet 
very used (i think).

&gt;<i> For sure, all the nodes will extend a base class that has all the 
</I>&gt;<i> goodies such as security, public/private methods and so on. The way I 
</I>&gt;<i> see it right now is to implement it a bit similar to the way YDRequest 
</I>&gt;<i> is implemented.
</I>
Sounds good :)

&gt;<i> I remember that for YDAcl, we had some stuff on the forum, right? If we 
</I>&gt;<i> can get this in a database independent way, I guess that's what we can 
</I>&gt;<i> use, no?
</I>
Sure.. YDAcl is really important. We could have some mechanism (in the 
abstract node class) that checks the db (on private methods) for correct 
authentication.. or maybe even a more smart way where it could check db 
just one time if it knows that we have private methods defined.
Why this class we can define on private methods the minimun level for 
that method (based on acl).. then, the abstract class would 
automagically test db authentication for user/pass/level.. just some ideas.

&gt;<i> For the schema updates, I don't think there will be a problem. With some 
</I>&gt;<i> tricks such as serialized objects, we can very easily overcome this. By 
</I>&gt;<i> just updating the object definitions, the rest will already happen 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically without having to change anything to the database.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; I wanted to share an idea with you about what I call a &quot;Content
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Management Framework&quot;, which I might be adding to the framework.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Essentially, I would like to add a system that makes it easy to
</I>&gt;<i>     create a
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; CMS based on the Yellow Duck Framework by avoiding to have to do the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; same work over and over again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This idea sounds good, especially because, as you know, i'm a little
</I>&gt;<i>     involved is those caind of applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Any suggestions, additions, comments, remarks?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     My opinion is that the core (ydf) should have some important features
</I>&gt;<i>     before starting the (ydCMf), eg YDError. This is, imho, extremely
</I>&gt;<i>     important in a application and if not done now, it will be integrated
</I>&gt;<i>     later in CMf and that's bad. We will have 2x the job because we will
</I>&gt;<i>     port the framework _and_ the CMframework. Other feature is the Locale.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I think that all nodes should extend an abstract class that, eg, checks
</I>&gt;<i>     autentication and/or has an mecanism where we can define public methods
</I>&gt;<i>     (that can be invoked in the template side) and private methods that
</I>&gt;<i>     will
</I>&gt;<i>     only work if the class detects that the user is authenticated.
</I>&gt;<i>     To be perfect, this means that we could have some mecanism (ACL)
</I>&gt;<i>     integrated in that master class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So, the idea about a tree of components and some automatic store and
</I>&gt;<i>     retrieve sounds excellent but i think we must care about YDError,
</I>&gt;<i>     YDLocale, YDACL? and then start integration those and start creating
</I>&gt;<i>     nodes.. just my 0.02
