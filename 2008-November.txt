Check out my Multiply site

I set up a Multiply site with my pictures, videos and blog and I want 
to add you as my friend so you can see it. First, you need to join 
Multiply! Once you join, you can also create your own site and share 
anything you want, with anyone you want.

Here's the link:

Thanks,
Carlos
